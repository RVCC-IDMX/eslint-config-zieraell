# An Eslint Configuration Test

## Let's Learn an ESLint Rule

Even though javascript automatically inserts semicolons (ASI) at the end of every line,
sometimes it will not (for example multiline code), producing unexpected errors.<br>
This is why it is considered good practice to follow the eslint "semi" rule and manually insert semicolons at the end of your statements,
to know when ASI takes place, and when it does not.
